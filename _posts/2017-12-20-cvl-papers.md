title: Reviews from Vision and Language course at Georgia Tech, Fall 2017
---

This fall semester, I took a class on [Vision and Language](http://www.prism.gatech.edu/~arjun9/CS8803_CVL_Fall17/), taught by Prof. Devi Parikh. Part of the class involved writing ~1 page long review/summaries of various recent papers related to AI tasks involving both visual perception and language processing, generally involving deep learning. 

I decided to post a few of my reviews for posterity and just in case anyone is looking for what is hopefully a decent summary of each paper's contributions, strengths, and weaknesses, in my eyes.
