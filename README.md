## James Mullenbach

I'm an MS student at Georgia Tech in Computer Science.
I'm studying natural language processing in the [Computational Linguistics Lab](https://gtnlp.wordpress.com) with professor Jacob Eisenstein. 

Specifically, I've been working on neural network models to label clinical texts with diagnosis codes, especially focusing on their interpretability.

In the summer of 2017 I worked as a data science intern at [Zappos.com](https://zappos.com) on machine learning problems, including classifying user behavior using clickstream data. 

I also started writing some thoughts in a <a href="https://jmullenbach.blogspot.com">blog</a> recently. I'm trying to improve my writing, so I'd love to know your thoughts.
