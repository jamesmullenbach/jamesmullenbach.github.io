<p>I'm a research engineer at <a href="https://asapp.com">ASAPP</a> working on healthcare-focused, ML-driven features for our customer interaction platform. Like <a href="https://www.asapp.com/blog/using-machine-learning-to-bring-context-to-conversations-with-patients/">this one</a>.</p>

<p>Clinical machine learning efforts, and ML efforts in general, can suffer from a pattern of excellent performance in terms of chosen metrics on prepared experimental datasets, followed by a puzzling lack of demonstrated value when evaluated in real world settings. This obstacle has proven pervasive and difficult to overcome. So I like thinking about how we might thoughtfully move proof-of-concept machine learning models into usable products that can actually measurably improve health outcomes. I tend to think we focus too little on first identifying the right problems, and on the role of design in successful ML applications. </p>

<p>In healthcare, so much information about a patient is recorded exclusively in written reports: living conditions, social history, future care plans, to name a few. So, I also like to think about how to usefully extract that information for targeted purposes. I focused on this problem while getting my master's at Georgia Tech, with a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.05695">notable success</a> in automated ICD coding from discharge summaries. </p>

<p>Regarding AI more broadly, I agree with the view that general common sense reasoning is fundamental to intelligence, and likely won't be robustly learned by large neural networks on observational data, <a href="https://lacker.io/ai/2020/07/06/giving-gpt-3-a-turing-test.html">no matter how large</a>. I don't do research in this area actively, but I did a wonderful internship at the <a href="https://www.isi.edu/projects/nlg/summer_internships">USC Information Sciences Institute</a> exploring this problem through the lens of <a href="https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D19-1625/">part-whole relations.</a> </p>

<p>In the past, I really enjoyed getting my feet wet in industrial data science at <a href="https://jobs.jobvite.com/zappos/">Zappos</a>  during an internship there in Las Vegas (you should apply), and gaining foundations in software engineering spending a couple summers at Atlanta startup Urjanet.</p>

<p>Outside of working hours I like to go on long runs in cities or on trails (I want to run a 100 mile race in the next couple of years), attempt to read nonfiction and fiction (there's a huge non-US history shaped gap in my personal knowledge base), daydream about travel (when such a thing can resume again), find cool new people to follow on twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/jmullenbach_">hit me up</a>), and overuse parentheticals.
