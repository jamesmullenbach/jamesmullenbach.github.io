<p>I’m an MS student at Georgia Tech in Computer Science with a specialization in Machine Learning.</p>

 <p>I’ve been working on Clinical NLP with professors <a href="https://cc.gatech.edu/~jeisenst">Jacob Eisenstein</a> and <a href="http://sunlab.org">Jimeng Sun</a>, focusing on learning of effective and interpretable document representations.</p>

<p>In the summer of 2017 I worked as a data science intern at <a href="https://zappos.com">Zappos.com</a> on machine learning problems, including classifying user behavior using clickstream data.</p>

<p>I also have a nascent <a href="/blog">blog</a>. I’m trying to improve my writing, so I’d love to know your thoughts.</p>
