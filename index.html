<h2 id="james-mullenbach">James Mullenbach</h2>

<p>I’m an MS student at Georgia Tech in Computer Science.
I’m studying natural language processing in the <a href="https://gtnlp.wordpress.com">Computational Linguistics Lab</a> with professor Jacob Eisenstein.</p>

<p>Specifically, I’ve been working on neural network models to label clinical texts with diagnosis codes, especially focusing on their interpretability.</p>

<p>In the summer of 2017 I worked as a data science intern at <a href="https://zappos.com">Zappos.com</a> on machine learning problems, including classifying user behavior using clickstream data.</p>

<p>I also started writing some thoughts in a <a href="/blog">blog</a> recently. I’m trying to improve my writing, so I’d love to know your thoughts.</p>
