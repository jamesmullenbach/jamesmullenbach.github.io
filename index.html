<p>I'm a machine learning engineer at <a href="https://layerhealth.com">Layer Health</a> working on the LLM-powered information layer for healthcare. I'm based in the great city of Atlanta. Earlier, I worked on high-level APIs for TensorFlow at Google, and on healthcare ML research and production dialog systems at <a href="https://asapp.com">ASAPP</a>.</p>

<p>Outside of working hours I like to go on <a href="https://ultrasignup.com/m_results_participant.aspx?fname=James&lname=Mullenbach">really really long runs</a> in cities or on trails, sporadically <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10898711-james-mullenbach">read</a> nonfiction and fiction, and find cool new people to follow on twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/jmullenbach_">hit me up</a>).
