<p>I'm a software engineer at Google working on high-level APIs for TensorFlow, based in the great city of Atlanta. Earlier, I worked on healthcare ML research and built production dialog systems at <a href="https://asapp.com">ASAPP</a>.</p>

<p>Outside of working hours I like to go on long runs in cities or on trails (I plan to run a 100 mile race in the next couple of years), attempt to <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10898711-james-mullenbach">read</a> nonfiction and fiction, daydream about travel, and find cool new people to follow on twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/jmullenbach_">hit me up</a>).
