        <h1>Futurism and ethics</h1>
<p class='meta'>20 Apr 2017</p>

<div class='post'>
    <p>It seems tone-deaf for someone to be surprised that people are not generally on-board with what is seen as an exciting new technology. Tim Urban’s <a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2017/04/neuralink.html">wait but why blog</a> posted recently on Elon Musk’s new venture Neuralink. A bit into part 4, maybe 2/3 of the way down the post (in the style of his other Musk posts, it’s incredibly long), he shows a public opinion poll on brain chip implants that Neuralink will research and develop - more people are worried than enthusiastic.</p>

<p>But the same post got me wondering why anybody would be surprised at that result. Sure, people will always be wary of a big change, like Lasik, pacemakers, and other examples he gives. But this ignores another big important reason to be worried. Urban paints a grandiose picture of brain-computer interfaces as the next step in human intellectual development; how could anybody be against that? Well, consider books and writing systems - how much inequality was created throughout history based on literacy/illiteracy? If a new technology isn’t accessible to everybody, some people will get superpowers and some won’t. The ones who won’t will be the ones who are already behind. I feel that technology can create inequalities in this way generally, and the potential is especially high in this specific case.</p>

<p>Maybe I’m wrong. I’m making an assumption that affordability would be the big deciding factor in any cognition-enhancing brain implant. Regardless, it gives me pause when I see a certain lack of regard for ethical considerations. We don’t need to floor it all the time with new tech. I wish we took more time to make sure we aren’t ruining something when we take a new step forward.</p>
